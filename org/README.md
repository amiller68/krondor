# Org

The `krondor` frontend application, can serve as a template for a NextJS application or Blog.
This site is built using NextJS, IPFS, and Ethereum in order to serve and manage the owners content.

I hope to decentralize more of this as I keep on building. Right now this site is hosted on centralized server, but I want to implement static hosting and distrobution on IPFS.

Feel free to fork this repository and use it for your own projects, as well as suggest updates or improvements.
